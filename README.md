# Epitope Analysis Tool [In progress]

A lightweight Python module for structural bioinformatics tasks, including sequence extraction, alignment, and B-factor analysis from PDB/mmCIF files.

## Features

- Extract amino acid sequences from Biopython `Structure` objects
- Align chains from different structures
- Compare B-factors residue-by-residue with flexible modes (CÎ±-only or full atom average)

## Installation

You can install it locally from the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GravityPHY/epitope_analysis.git
cd epitope_analysis
pip install .
```
or 
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/analysis_tool.git
```
